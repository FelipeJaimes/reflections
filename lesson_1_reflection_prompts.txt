How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps me find the differences between both files and highlight what changes can be creating the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Yes! becouse you can try different solutions and changes with the fear of loosing the past content forever

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    YOu can commit in a manual and more controled way

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    PRO there is more control of the history and you avoid big history files. CON, is open to human error.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Because the files are part of the same project and are related each other.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it gives me the opportunity to make mistakes in the good way of exploring solutions and ideas with out worring about losing considerably amount of work or spoiling 
    the project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it for my future projects, and this way i can have a better work practices 
    with my co workers and code in a more secure way.
