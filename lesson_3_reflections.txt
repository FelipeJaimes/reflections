When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working with a team, so all the members can acces and sync the code of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way i can have more control over my local repository, this means, i can work without
    worring about any mistakes being sync to the remote. I can push my commits to the remote
    when i want i when im certain that everything is okay and that i want to push.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is when you copy somewhere else repository in github to your github account, so you can work with the 
    reopsitory, without affecting the user original one. A clone is when you get a GitHub
    repository and copy it to your local machine or copy from local to local. Branch is when you
    want to make changes (or different versions) in your repository without affecting the master branch, so you make a 
    branch and in parallel work in the same repository, then when you are sure the changes are
    okey, you can merge those branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This way, git can know if you are ahead, behid, out of sync or 
    up to date with your remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using for example dropbox, the UX and the learning curve would
    be a lot easier, but manage conflicts, manage bugs, and have 
    a more efficent work motodology would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
